    <p class="pa pa-header p">Dependability Modeling and Design refers to the real interaction between business and dependability ability technology based on the support and capabilities provided by information technology.</p>
    <p class="pa pa-content p">With increasing complexity of critical systems such as industrial control systems, automobiles, robots, assessing and ensuring the reliability and safety, as well as other dependability aspects such as robustness, integrity, maintainability, and accountability becomes challenging for manufacturers, owners, and operators. For addressing these issues, advanced technologies, appropriate methodology, powerful modelling languages and tools, and shared conceptualization of dependability modelling and design are investigated. The WDMD seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange and discuss advanced researches and practical application in the areas of dependability modelling and design, with a focus on three topics: conceptual model for dependability, digitalization design for dependability, and software dependability.</p>

    <div class="title2 section-title">Conceptual Model for Dependability</div>
    <p class="pa pa-header p">With the development of science and technology, the composition of the system becomes more and more complex, resulting in more and more prominent problems of system dependability. In addition, with the continuous evolution from closed system to autonomous system, the conceptual model of dependability based on closed systems is no longer applicable for autonomous systems. How to construct a new conceptual model for dependability based on the human factors, specifications, implementations, environments, and requirements becomes a very challenging problem.</p>

    <div class="title2 section-title">Digitalization Design for Dependability</div>
    <p class="pa pa-header p">System dependability engineering is key technique to deal with system failures during the whole life of the system. With the increasing complexity of the system, the construction for the dependability capability of the system development also becomes challenging. We expect dependability digital engineering system which can establish modeled and automated dependability analysis for the concept phase, planning phase, development phase, and verification phase, resulting in an interpretable, inheritable, and reusable dependability process technology.</p>

    <div class="title2 section-title">Software Dependability</div>
    <p class="pa pa-header p">The scale of the software system becomes larger and more complex, and its dependability is becoming much more difficult to guarantee. The applications of software also have high requirements for the dependability of system operation. In some critical application fields, such as digital wisdom medicine, precision manufacturing and so on, the dependability requirements are very high (at least 99.9999%). We expect to establish industry available software dependability metrics system, evaluation model, design, and verification methods.</p>
