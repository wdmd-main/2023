          <span class="bold">Abstract: </span>
          <span class="italic">&nbsp;Systems engineering today is torn between two contradictory trends. On the one hand, the construction of intelligent systems, capable of situation awareness and adaptive decision-making through the use of AI-based components; on the other, the need for trustworthiness guarantees despite the non-explicability of AI components. The situation is exacerbated by the need for increasingly complex and integrated heterogeneous systems, and by the fact that in the current debate on "safe AI", key players in the field are promoting approaches that break with the technical safety concept of systems engineering.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="italic indent">We consider that a system is explainable if it is possible to characterize its relevant behavior by faithful models that lend themselves to analysis and provide a basis for understanding. We argue that AI will remain largely inexplicable. Ignoring this limitation by ascribing anthropomorphic properties to AI systems is technically untenable.</p>
        <p class="italic indent">We need rigorous system design methodologies that integrate model-based and data-driven AI te chniques, enabling in particular the construction of reliable systems integrating unreliable AI components. These methodologies will be characterized by the following important changes: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="italic indent">Breaking with the idea that system can be guaranteed trustworthy at design time. Instead, systems must be designed to evolve, with no endpoint in their evolution, using computational intelligence, monitoring techniques and over-the-air upgrades.</li>
          <li class="italic indent">A shift from verification to empirical validation using test and simulation, which in principle does not allow confidence levels achieved using model-based methods. </li>
          <li class="italic indent">A better integration of design for dependability into the system development cycle, by jointly addressing safety and security issues, and relying heavily on automated tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic indent">We advocate the need for a new foundation for system design that responds to these needs, leveraging knowledge management to compensate for weaknesses arising from the obsolescence of model-based techniques.</p>

          <span>&nbsp;Professor Joseph Sifakis is Emeritus Research Director at Verimag. He has been a full professor at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) for the period 2011-2016. He is the founder of the Verimag laboratory in Grenoble, a leading laboratory in the area of safety critical systems that he directed for 13 years.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">Joseph Sifakis has made significant and internationally recognized contributions to the design of trustworthy systems in many application areas, including avionics and space systems, telecommunications, and production systems. His current research focuses on autonomous systems, in particular self-driving cars and autonomous telecommunication systems. In 2007, he received the Turing Award, recognized as the "highest distinction in computer science", for his contribution to the theory and application of model checking, the most widely used system verification technique. </p>
        <p class="indent">Joseph Sifakis is a member of six academies and a frequent speaker at international scientific, technical and public forums.</p>
